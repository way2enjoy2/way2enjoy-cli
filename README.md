## Preamble

To use way2enjoy CLI, you need an API key for way2enjoy. You can get one at [https://way2enjoy.com/developers](https://way2enjoy.com/developers).

## Usage

way2enjoy CLI allows you to provide your API key in two different ways. The more convenient one is to save the API key into a file called `.way2enjoy` within your home directory. The other way is to provide it as an option while running the CLI.

	way2enjoy demo.png -k Hk09oPOI899j98080970990

To optimize all JPG, PNG, GIF images , PDF, MP3, MP4 files and all Music/Video files within the current directory, you may run one of the following commandsâ€”both do exactly the same.

	way2enjoy assets/img1 assets/img2

To shrink a single image (`assets/img/demo.png` in this example), you may run the following command.

	way2enjoy assets/img/demo.png

You may also provide multiple images.

	way2enjoy assets/img/demo1.png assets/img/demo2.png

To resize an image, use the `--width` and/or `--height` flag.
